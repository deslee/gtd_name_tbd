# Concept of Operations

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to implement a minimal, reliable , and usable method of implementing the GTD framework.

The project is meant to provide features that other GTD related applications do not.

### Definitions

1. The application will be **minimal**. It will be as unopinionated as possible, and follow the GTD model as strictly as possible for maximum flexibility.

2. The application will be **reliable**. Data will be persisted using Google Drive and Google Calendar. Google is considered a reliable services, and using Google API eliminates the need to write our own backend.

3. The application will be **usable**. Users will be uninhibited by UI distractions, and data will be presented as cleanly and unobtrusively as possible. The goal of the system is to make it as easy as possible to collect *tasks*, *ideas*, and *projects*.

## Lists

The GTD framework "works" by maintaining lists, one of the most simple methods of aggregating information.

### In List

This is the most important list in the application. The purpose of this list is to help the user capture *ideas* and *tasks* as quickly, easily, and simply as possible. The User will be encouraged to enter any idea and task that occurs to them.

#### Processing the In List

The application will make it simple and trivial for the User to process the In List.

According to the GTD framework, if the In List item is **actionable**, the User will be encouraged to list the next *physical* and *visible* action needed to make progress on the task.

If the In List item is not *actionable*, then the User can do one of 3 things. The User can discard the item, keep it as reference material (notes), or **incubate** it (i.e., instruct the application to remind the User about the item in the distant future).
